## Ingredients

### Cake

- `1` teaspoon instant espresso
- `2/3` cup boiling water
- `2/3` cup cocoa powder (alternatively special dark cocoa powder)
- `2` teaspoon vanilla extract
- `2 2/3` cup cake flour
- `1 1/2` teaspoon baking soda
- `1/2` teaspoon salt
- `2 1/2` cup granulated sugar
- `16` tablespoon (`2` stick) unsalted butter
- `4` egg
- `2` egg yolk
- `1/2` cup vegetable oil

### Frosting (make 2 batches)

- `1/2` cup unsalted butter, melted
- `1/2` cup cocoa powder
- `5` cup powdered sugar
- `3/4` cup heavy whipping cream
- `1` teaspoon vanilla extract
- `1` pinch salt

### Decorations

- `1/2` block of chocolate almond bark
- whipped cream
- `8` cherries
- `1` tall white candle

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
2. Butter three 9 inch round cake pans, bottoms and sides, then sprinkle the pans with flour, then cut out parchment paper in circles to fit the bottom of the cake pans and place those in the pan.
3. Boil water and add espresso to it, stirring until dissolved.
4. Whisk cocoa powder, then buttermilk and vanilla extract into water/espresso mixture.
5. Sift flour, baking soda, and salt into a separate bowl.
6. Using a stand mixer, cream butter and granulated sugar, about 10 minutes.
7. Add each egg and the yolk one at a time, into the butter mixture, letting each one fully mix into the batter before adding the next. Add in oil and mix until fully combined. Then beat mixture on medium high speed for about a minute. The mixture will be light and fluffy.
8. Fold in half of the flour mixture and then fold in half of the buttermilk mixture to the batter. Then fold in remaining flour mixture and then the remaining buttermilk mixture.
9. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Try baking the cakes on the same rack, or baking them one at a time. This will ensure even baking.

### Frosting

1. Melt butter and mix in cocoa powder and salt.
2. Alternate stirring in the powdered sugar and milk in increments.
3. Stir in vanilla extract.

### Assembly

1. Once cakes are cooled, level them by cutting off any raised dome structures.
2. Grate your almond bark to make chocolate shavings. I used a cheese grater and grated about half of the large chocolate bar.
3. Place a little bit of frosting on a cardboard cake round and then place the first layer of cake on top of that.
4. Add at least 1/2 cup of frosting on top of the first layer and spread out into a nice thick even layer. Repeat with the second and third layers.
5. Gently press the chocolate shavings over the entire cake.
6. Using whipped cream, pipe 8 dollops of whipped cream onto the top in a circle.
7. Place a cherry on each dollop of whipped cream (it might help to dry the cherries off with a paper towel before placing them on the whipped cream).
8. Add a tall white candle in the middle. Enjoy!
