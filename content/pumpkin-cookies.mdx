## Ingredients

### Spiced sugar

- `1/4` cup granulated sugar
- `1/2` teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

### Pumpkin cookies

- `6` tablespoon (`3/4` stick) unsalted butter, softened
- `1` cup light brown sugar, packed
- `2` egg yolks, at room temperature
- `2` teaspoon vanilla extract
- `1/2` cup (`122`g) canned pumpkin pureé (preferably Libby's)
- `1 3/4` cup all-purpose flour
- `1` tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
- `1/2` teaspoon baking soda
- `1/2` teaspoon baking powder
- `1/2` teaspoon salt

## Instructions

### Spiced sugar

1. In a small bowl, mix the granulated sugar and pumpkin pie spice together. Set aside.

### Pumpkin cookies

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Start by drying the pumpkin (not optional). Spread the canned pumpkin on a plate and lightly press with a paper towl to absorb the excess liquid. Repeat the step at least four more times. The pumpkin should be dry enough that it goes from being 1/2 cup dried down to just about a 1/4 cup. Hardly any liquid should transfer onto a paper towel once it has been dried enough. Set aside.

<Tip>
Libby's pumpkin pureé works best because most cans of it have the same consistency and are not too wet.

3. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
4. In a large bowl, cream the softened butter and brown sugar together with an electric mixer on high speed for 1-2 minutes until light and fluffy.
5. Add in the egg yolks and vanilla and mix on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 1-2 minutes.
6. Add in the pumpkin and mix on medium-low speed to combine.
7. Add in the dry ingredients and mix on low speed until just combined.
8. Scoop the dough with a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop and roll them into balls. Then roll the dough balls in the spiced sugar.
9. Place the cookie dough balls at least 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. You can usually get 6 on a sheet.
10. Bake the cookies for 12-14 minutes. 12 minutes for chewy centers, 14 minutes for a slightly crispier cookie. When the cookies are done baking, the centers will be puffy. As they cool, they centers will fall and the cookie will get slightly wrinkly.
11. Let the cookies cool on the vaking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack to finish cooling. They are best enjoyed when they have cooled for at least 15 minutes.
