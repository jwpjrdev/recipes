## Ingredients

- 2 (9-inch) <a href="/recipes/pie-crust">pie crust</a>, homemade or store bought
- 2 14 1/2 ounce canned cherries, tart or sweet
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon almond or vanilla extract
- 3 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 pinch salt

<Tip>
You can substitute cornstarch for all-purpose flour at a 2 to 1 ratio; two tablespoons flour for every tablespoon cornstarch.
</Tip>

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425Â°F.
2. Pour entire contents of canned cherries into sauce pan as well as cornstarch (or all-purpose flour), sugar, and salt. Stir until cherries are evenly coated.
3. Bring mixture to medium high heat and cook for 10-15 minutes while stirring constantly. Cornstarch will begin to bubble and then thicken. Remove from heat after mixture has bubbled for about 1 minute.
4. Stir in almond (or vanilla) extract.
5. Add a pie crust to a pie pan and trim off excess crust from edges and pour cherry pie filling into the pie crust.
6. Cut butter into slices and evenly space them on top of the pie filling.
7. Add second pie crust on top. Cut slits if it isn't a lattice crust.
8. Pinch edges of crust together and cover edges in aluminum foil.
9. Bake for 10 minutes at 425 degrees F and then reduce heat to 350 degrees F and bake for an additional 30-35 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.
10. Remove from oven and cool before slicing. This can take multiple hours.
