## Ingredients

- `1 1/2` cup all-purpose flour
- `1` teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
- `1` teaspoon baking soda
- `3/4` teaspoon salt
- `16` tablespoon (`2` stick) unsalted butter, softened
- `1` cup light or dark brown sugar
- `1/2` cup granulated sugar
- `2` egg, room temperature
- `1` tablespoon molasses

<Tip>
Use unsulphured or dark molasses. Do not use blackstrap. If you do not have any molasses, leave it out.
</Tip>

- `2` teaspoon vanilla extract
- `3` cup old-fashioned whole rolled oats
- `1 3/4` cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Whisk the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
2. In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the brown sugar and granulated sugar and beat on medium-high speed until creamed, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs, molasses, and vanilla extract and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the buttom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.
3. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. With the mixer running on low speed, beat in the oats and both types of chocolate chips. The dough will be thick and sticky. Cover and chill the dough for at least 45 minutes in the refridgerator (and up to 4 days). If chilling for longer than a few hours, allow to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before scooping and baking because the dough will be quite hard.
4. Preheat over to 350Â°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
5. Use a large cookie scoop to scoop the cookie dough into groups of 8 or 12 cookies. Bake for 11-13 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The centers will look very soft.
6. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
7. Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.
