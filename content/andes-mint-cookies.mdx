## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
2. In a medium size bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a separate medium size bowl with a hand held mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter and brown sugar on medium speed. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula. Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat again on medium speed until combined with no lumps.
4. With the mixer on low, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in 2 additions, mixing thoroughly after each addition. Fold in chopped Andes Mints with a spatula.
5. Using a cookie scoop (1.5 tablespoon), scoop onto baking sheets. Bake for 10-12 minutes until sides just begin to brown.
6. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 1-2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
