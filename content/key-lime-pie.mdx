</Tip>

- `3` egg yolk

- `1` (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk

</Tip>

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
2. In an electric mixer with a wire whisk attachment or with a handheld mixer, beat the egg yolks and lime zest at high speed until very fluffy, about 5 minutes.
3. Gradually add condensed milk and continue to beat until thick, 3 or 4 minutes longer. Lower the mixer speed and slowly add the lime juice, mixing until just combined, not any longer.
4. Pour the mixture into the crust. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the filling has just set. Cool on a wire rack, then refrigerate. Freeze for 15 to 20 minutes before serving. Best served with whipped cream.
