## Ingredients

- `1 1/2` cup granulated sugar
- `3/4` cup all-purpose flour
- `2/3` cup cocoa powder
- `1/2` cup powdered sugar
- `1/2` cup dark chocolate chips
- `3/4` teaspoon sea salt
- `2` egg
- `1/2` cup canola oil
- `2` tablespoon water
- `1/2` teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325Â°F. Prepare an 8x8 pan by lining it with parchment paper and then spraying it with nonstick spray. If you use a 9x9 pan, the brownies will overcook.
2. In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla extract.
4. Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached. It's better to take the brownies out of the oven early than to leave them in too long. When the brownies come out of the oven, they will be gooey in the middle. Cool completely, about 2 hours, before slicing. If you prefer a firmer brownie, allow them to set longer or store them in the fridge.
