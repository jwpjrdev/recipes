- `1/2` teaspoon baking powder
- `1` teaspoon salt
- `8` tablespoon (`1` stick) unsalted butter, softened
- `1/2` cup packed brown sugar
- `1/2` cup granulated sugar
- `1` egg
- `1` teaspoon vanilla extract
- `1` cup chocolate chips (milk chocolate or semi-sweet)

### Brownie Batter

- `8` tablespoon (`1` stick) unsalted butter, cubed
- `3/4` cup bittersweet chocolate chips
- `1 1/2` cup granulated sugar
- `3` egg
- `1/4` cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- `1/2` teaspoon salt
- `1/2` teaspoon vanilla extract
- `2/3` cup all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Prepare a 9 by 13 pan by lining it with parchment paper and then spraying it with nonstick spray.
2. To make the cookie dough, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside.
3. In a stand mixer, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar. Then, beat in the egg and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Stir in the chocolate chips until evenly combined.
4. Prepare the brownie batter by melting the butter and bittersweet chocolate chips in a small saucepan on low heat, stir occasionally.
5. Add granulated sugar into a medium bowl.
6. Remove saucepan from heat and whisk contents into the granulated sugar. Whisk in eggs one at a time until combined. Whisk in the cocoa powder, salt, and vanilla extract. Then, use a spatula to fold in the all-purpose flour until combined.
7. Pour the brownie batter into the prepared pan. Smooth and level the top with a spatula. Then, crumble the cookie dough evenly over the batter.
8. Lightly cover with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 28-30 minutes.
9. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack. Lift the brownies out using the parchment paper and cut into squares.
