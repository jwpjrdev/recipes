## Ingredients

### Cookies

- `2 1/4` cup (`286`g) all-purpose flour
- `1/2` teaspoon baking powder
- `1/2` teaspoon salt
- `16` tablespoon (`2` stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
- `3/4` cup (`150`g) granulated sugar
- `2` tablespoon lemon zest
- `1` egg, room temperature

### Glaze

- `1 1/2` cup (`189`g) powdered sugar, sifted
- `2` to `4` tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- Additional lemon zest, to garnish, if desired

## Instructions

### Cookies

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
2. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. Set aside.
3. Cream together the butter, sugar, and lemon zest until light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes, scraping down the bowl at least once. Beat in egg until very well combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl. On low speed, add the flour mixture and blend until just incorporated. Dough will be slightly dry.
4. Use a small cookie scoop to scoop dough onto a baking sheet, 2 inches apart. Roll each ball with your palms, then using your palm, gently flatten dough to about 1/3-inch thick.
5. Bake for 12-14 minutes or until cookies are just set and and slightly golden brown at the edges. Cool cookies on baking sheet for 5 minutes and transfer to cooling racks. Cool completely.

### Glaze

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together powdered sugar and lemon juice, a tablespoon at a time, until a very thick but pourable glaze forms.
2. Spoon each cookie with the lemon glaze. Garnish with extra lemon zest, if desired. Let cookies sit until icing has set, at least 30 minutes.

<Tip>
**Cookie Bars**

Line an 8x8-inch pan with parchment paper. Press dough evenly into the pan and bake for 23-25 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown and the center is no longer wet. Cool in pan for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, use a spatula to evenly coat the cookie bars with glaze (use `2` tablespoon lemon juice + `1 1/2` cup powdered sugar for a thick glaze that sets perfectly), then optionally garnish with lemon zest. Let set for 30 minutes before slicing into bars.
