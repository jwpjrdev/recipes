- `5` tablespoon unsalted butter, melted

### Cheesecake

- `1/4` cup coffee, hot
- `1` cup bittersweet chocolate
- `3/4` cup semisweet chocolate
- `24` ounce (`3` 8 ounce packages) cream cheese, softened to room temperature
- `1` pinch salt
- `1` cup (`200`g) granulated sugar
- `1/4` cup sour cream
- `1` tablespoon vanilla extract
- `4` egg, room temperature
- `3` tablespoon all-purpose flour

### Ganache

- `1/3` cup semisweet chocolate
- `1/3` cup whipping cream

### Chocolate whipped cream

- `2` cup heavy cream
- `1/4` cup powdered sugar
- `2` teaspoon vanilla extract
- `3` tablespoon cocoa powder, plus more if needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350째F.
2. Add Oreoes to a food processor and pulse until broken into small pieces. Pour in melted butter while pulsing processor. Remove blades and use a spatula to mix butter in completely.
3. Transfer mixture to your springform pan and spread out with a spatula so the crumbs are evenly distributed on the bottom and toward the side as well. Press into a flat layer using a tall glass and compact the side so it keeps its shape after cutting. Bake for about 10 minutes, or until fragrant and a darker golden color. Remove from oven, set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 325째F.

### Filling

1. Place chocolate chips in a bowl then pour the hot coffee over them. Mix a bit then microwave in a few 20 second intervals as needed, stirring in between. Once almost all of the chocolate is melted cover and set aside, the residual heat should melt the remaining chocolate while you make the batter.
2. Add room temperature cream cheese to stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix at medium speed to cream.
3. Add the granulated sugar to the bowl and mix on medium until creamy. Scrape the bowl down and mix until evenly combined.
4. Add sour cream and vanilla extract, mix well then add the eggs and yolks one at a time, allowing each to incorporate before adding the next. Sprinkle in the flour and continue to mix. Scrape the bowl down and mix until completely smooth.
5. Pour in the melted chocolate and mix on low until combined. Scrape the bowl down and mix once more.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared 8 or 9" springform pan The batter will not rise much at all during the bake so you can fill it up almost to the top.
7. Place springform pan onto a cookie sheet covered in foil to prevent leaks.
8. Bake at 325째F for 20 minutes then reduce temperature to 300째F and bake another 30 minutes or until the cake's edge is set but the center is still wobbly. Turn oven off but leave door closed and allow cake to rest for an additional hour in the oven. Remove from oven and cool to room temperature then cover with a towel or paper towel and chill overnight.

### Ganache

1. Melt the chocolate and whipping cream in a small bowl. You can use a double boiler, microwave, or heat the cream before mixing in.
2. Spread the ganache onto the cake and return to refrigerator to chill while you make the chocolate whipped cream.

### Chocolate whipped cream

1. Add the cold heavy cream, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar to a stand mixer or a large bowl with a hand mixer. Sift in the cocoa powder then mix with a whisk attachment (or hand mixer) until semi-stiff peaks form.
2. Transfer whipped cream to a piping bag fitted with a star attachment and pipe onto the cake's edge using small circular motions.
