- `1/3` cup packed brown sugar
- `3` tablespoon butter, melted

### Wet mixture

- `8` tablespoon (`1` stick) unsalted butter
- `1` cup granulated sugar
- `2` egg, at room temperature

<Tip>

</Tip>

- `1/2` cup milk
- `1/2` tablespoon vanilla extract
- `1/2` teaspoon almond extract

### Dry mixture

- `2` cup all-purpose flour
- `2` teaspoon baking powder
- `1/4` teaspoon salt

### Blueberry mixture

- `2` cup blueberries (fresh or frozen)
- `2` tablespoon all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Place paper liners in 12 cup muffin tin and spray with nonstick spray.
2. Brown butter and pour into medium bowl. Let sit for 10 minutes or until cool enough to touch.
3. While the brown butter cools, make the topping by mixing together the flour, cinnamon, and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Add in the melted butter (not the brown butter) and stir together with a fork until it begins to form into crumbles and resembles pea-sized clumps. You may need to use your hands/fingers to form into nice crumbles. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.
4. Make the dry mixture by whisking together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside.
5. Make the wet mixture by creaming together the brown butter and sugar. Ensure that eggs are at room temperature and slowy add them in one at a time.
6. Next, add in milk, vanilla extract, and almond extract, mixing until the wet mixture is smooth and well combined.
7. Slowly add in dry ingredients, mixing with a wooden spoon until just combined. Do not overmix.
8. Make the blueberry mixture by adding blueberries and flour to a medium bowl. Stir to coat the blueberries with flour. This is so the blueberries do not fall to the bottom of the muffins while baking.
9. Gently fold blueberries into muffin batter and divide batter evenly between the muffin liners.
10. Sprinkle topping on top.
11. Bake for 23-28 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.
12. Allow muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before removing.
