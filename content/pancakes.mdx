TODO: measure out 1 batch of drys in grams so that you can prepare the drys ahead of time and add the wets when making the pancakes. Figure out how many grams of powder to use per batch. e.g. 500g/batch
</Tip>

## Ingredients

- `1 1/2` cup all-purpose flour
- `3 1/2` teaspoon baking powder
- `1` tablespoon granulated sugar
- `1/4` teaspoon salt, or more to taste
- `1 1/4` cup milk
- `3` tablespoon butter, melted
- `1` egg
- `1/2` teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Heat a griddle to 350Â°F.
2. Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together milk, melted butter, egg, and vanilla extract.
4. Make a well in the dry mixture and pour in the wet mixture. Mix until combined, do not overmix.
5. Spoon 1/4 cup of batter onto griddle per pancake and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
