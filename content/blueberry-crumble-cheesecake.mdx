- `2` cup (`250`g) graham cracker crumbs
- `2` tablespoon granulated sugar
- `5` tablespoon (`75`g) butter, melted

### Blueberries

- `1 2/3` cup (`300`g) fresh blueberries
- `1` tablespoon granulated sugar
- `1` tablespoon all-purpose flour
- `1 1/2` teaspoon lemon juice

### Crumble

- `1` cup (`110`g) all-purpose flour
- `6 1/2` tablespoon (`80`g) dark brown sugar
- `4` tablespoon (`57`g) butter, melted

### Cheesecake

- `28` ounce (`3 1/2` 8 ounce packages) cream cheese, softened to room temperature
- `1 1/4` cup (`260`g) granulated sugar
- `3/4` cup + 1 tablespoon (`200`g) sour cream, room temperature
- `1 1/2` tablespoon cornstarch
- `2 1/2` teaspoon vanilla extract
- `4` eggs, room temperature, lightly beaten

## Instructions

### Crust

1. Preheat oven to 325°F.
2. In a food processor, add the graham cracker crumbs and granulated sugar and blend it all together until a fine sand-like texture. Melt the butter. Add the melted butter to the food processor and blend it together with the blended mixture.
3. In a 9" springform pan add parchment paper to the bottom. Pour the crust mixture into the pan and press down with the bottom of a glass, and up against the side of the pan, so it's well packed together and flattened out.
4. Bake it for 10 minutes. Then let it cool down so that it's cool to touch. Keep the oven turned on.

### Blueberries and crumble

1. While the crust bakes, prepare the blueberries and the crumble.
2. In a small bowl, mix together the blueberries, granulated sugar, and all-purpose flour. Then add the lemon juice and mix it all together until there is no dry flour left. Set aside.
3. For the crumble, add the all-purpose flour and brown sugar to another bowl and mix it together. Melt the butter and pour it over the flour mixture. With a fork, mix it together until it forms a crumbled structure and there is no dry flour left. Set aside both toppings while making the cheesecake filling.

### Cheesecake

1. With a hand mixer or in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the cream cheese for 1 minute on low speed. Then add the granulated sugar and let it mix for 1 minute on low speed. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix it together for another 30 seconds.
2. In a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch and sour cream until smooth. Add it to the cream cheese with the vanilla extract and let it mix on low speed until combined.
3. Then add two eggs at a time and let it mix on low speed until combined. Once all the eggs have mixed in, scrape down the sides of the bowl and give it a final mix to make sure all the ingredients have incorporated.
<Tip>
Cheesecake requires a delicate balance—you must incorporate as little air as possible by mixing as little as you can get away with, but you must also scrape the sides and bottom to ensure that it is all evenly mixed with no lumps by mixing enough.

4. Pour the cheesecake batter into the springform pan. Gently divide the blueberries first on top of the cheesecake, followed by the crumble.
5. Boil up water in a kettle. Add a triple layer of aluminum foil around the cheesecake pan to safely seal it from the water before placing it in a baking pan or a roasting pan.
<Tip>
You can temporarily cover the cheesecake with aluminum foil if you are afraid of water getting in it while you pour the water bath.

6. Bake for 1 hour and 20-30 minutes.
7. Once the time has passed, give the tray a very gentle shake. The cheesecake should still be a little wobbly in the middle. Turn off the oven and leave the oven door slightly open and let the cheesecake cool down in the oven for 1 hour.
8. Then take it out of the oven and remove it from the water bath and place the cheesecake on a cooling rack. Let it cool down fully for about 1 hour to room temperature.
9. Finally, once at room temperature, place it in the fridge and let it set for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight, before eating.
<Tip>
Drastic changes in temperature can cause it to tear. Even just taking it out of the oven and leaving it to cool on the countertop can cause it to tear so be sure to allocate enough time for cooling.
