## Ingredients

- `3` cup all-purpose flour
- `1` teaspoon baking soda
- `1/2` teaspoon baking powder
- `1` teaspoon sea salt
- `16` tablespoon (`2` stick) unsalted butter, softened
- `1` cup granulated sugar
- `1` cup light brown sugar, packed
- `2` egg
- `2` teaspoon vanilla extract
- `2` cup chocolate chips

<Tip>
My personal preference for chocolate chips is an 11oz bag of milk chocolate chips and another 3oz of semisweet chocolate chips to get to the 2 cup mark for a single batch.

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
2. In a medium bowl mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and sea salt. Set aside.
3. Cream together butter and sugars until combined.
4. Beat in eggs and vanilla until light (about 1 minute).
5. Mix in the dry ingredients until combined.
6. Add chocolate chips and mix well.
7. Use a small cookie scoop to scoop dough onto a baking sheet, 2 inches apart.
8. Bake for approximately 8-10 minutes.

<Tip>
Do not overbake. Take them out when they are just *barely* starting to turn brown. Do not leave them in because they don't appear done—take them out and let them set. Adjust your times from there and bake accordingly. If you leave them in for even a minute or two longer than needed, they will burn. I recommend doing a test batch of 2 cookies to start with.

10. Place on cooling racks until room temperature and enjoy.
