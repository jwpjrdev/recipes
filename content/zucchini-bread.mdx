## Ingredients

- `1 3/4` cup all-purpose flour
- `1` teaspoon baking powder
- `1/2` teaspoon baking soda
- `1/2` teaspoon salt
- `1 1/2` teaspoon ground cinnamon
- `1/4` teaspoon ground nutmeg
- `1/2` cup vegetable oil
- `1/2` cup packed light or dark brown sugar
- `1/2` cup granulated sugar
- `2` egg, room temperature
- `1/4` cup unsweetened apple sauce
- `2` teaspoon vanilla extract
- `1 1/2` cup shredded zucchini

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
2. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Set aside.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk the oil, brown sugar, granulated sugar, eggs, apple sauce, and vanilla together until combined. Whisk in the zucchini.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Gently stir or whisk until just combined; do not overmix. Batter is slightly thick.
5. Spread the batter evenly into prepared loaf pan. Bake for 55-70 minutes. You can loosly cover the bread with aluminum foil halfway through to prevent heavy browning on top. Baking times vary so keep an eye on it. The bread is done when a toothpick comes out mostly clean with zero raw batter.
6. Remove the bread from the oven and set on a wire rack. Cool in pan for 1 hour before removing from pan. You can slice the bread at this point but it will still be warm in the center and may not slice neatly. For neat slices, continue cooling bread directly on a wire rack and then slice once cooled.
