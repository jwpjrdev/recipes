## Ingredients

- `1` cup cold heavy whipping cream
- `3` tablespoon powdered sugar
- `1/2` teaspoon vanilla (optional)
- `1/4` teaspoon cream of tartar (optional)

## Instructions

1. Chill your mixing bowl and beaters in the freezer for about 15 minutes.
2. Place the cold heavy whipping cream and powdered sugar, (along with vanilla and cream of tartar, if using), in the cold bowl.
3. Using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, beat on medium speed to start and then increase speed to high until the cream has thickened and soft peaks form.
4. Use the same day or store in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator for up to two days.

<Tip>
The cream of tartar helps the whipped cream hold its shape well and doesn't change the taste.
