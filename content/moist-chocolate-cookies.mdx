## Ingredients

- 1 cup (140 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 2/3 cup unsalted butter (optionally up to 1 extra tablespoon)
- 1/2 cup and 1/3 cup (total 175 grams) granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 large egg

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â° F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat and set aside.
2. In a small bowl, mix flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda.
3. Melt the butter in a small pan over medium heat until it is halfway melted. Remove from heat and stir until completely melted. Set aside to cool.
4. Place the sugar in a big bowl and mix in the butter. Add egg and vanilla and stir until combined.
5. Add the flour mixture in 2 batches and stir until completely combined. If needed, add up to 1 extra tablespoon of butter to help combine.
6. Roll the dough into 2 1/2 tablespoon balls and place them on the baking sheet. Alternatively, divide the dough into 10 equal pieces and roll into balls.
7. Bake for 8-11 minutes or until the cookies are slightly set. The top of the cookies should be soft and not wet. They will be too soft to handle. Remove the cookies from the oven.
8. Let cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes or until the bottom of the cookies are firm enough. They will be slightly puffy. You may optionally press them with the back of a spoon.
9. Serve or place in a tightly sealed container for up to a few days.
