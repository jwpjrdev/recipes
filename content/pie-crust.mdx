## Instructions

1. In a food processor, pulse together the flour and salt. Add butter and pulse until the mixture forms lima bean-sized pieces. Slowly add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse until the dough just comes together. It should be moist, but not wet.
2. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gather into a ball. Flatten into a disk with the heel of your hand.
3. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.
